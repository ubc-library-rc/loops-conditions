They cut down the length of your code, and can fill the role of functions when they do not meet your needs. We have gone over relatively simple cases today that could probably be accomplished through a package, for the purpose of instruction. The tools you learned today are incredibly powerful however when there is no suitable package for a particular task. ",

    "content": "For loops allow you to perform an operation iteratively in R (e.g., instead of repeating lines of code). Most functions you use in R are built using for loops. for (i in x) { . perform some operation using each value of x . } . i stands for iteration, and is set to each value of x in each iteration of the loop . x could be a vector, list, matrix, or any other sequence of values/objects .
