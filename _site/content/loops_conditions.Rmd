Workshop overview:

-   For loops
-   Conditional (if/else) statements
-   Additional practice problems

###GETTING STARTED

```{r}
#install.packages('openintro')
#install.packages('dplyr')
#install.packages('gapminder')

library(openintro)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

```

We will be using three datasets in this workshop:

(1) 'countries' from the gapminder package - Macroeconomic (e.g. GDP per
    capita) and demographic (e.g. population) data for every country in
    the world, by year

```{r}
countries <- gapminder # create a data frame
head(countries) #see the first six rows of the dataframe
```

(2) 'storms' from the dplyr package - Location and weather data for
    hurricanes in the US

```{r}
head(storms)
```

(3) 'midterms' from the openintro package - midterm election results by
    year, party, and unemployment rate

```{r}
midterms <- midterms_house
head(midterms)
```

###FOR LOOPS

For loop's basic structure

for (i in vector/list/matrix/dataframe){ some operation with i }

one step in a loop = one 'iteration'

numeric vector example:

```{r}
#a simple loop: 

numbers <- 1:10 #creating a vector of numbers 1 through 10 

for (i in numbers){
  print(i)
}

for (i in numbers){
  print(i)
  Sys.sleep(0.5) #this staggers each output by 0.5 seconds
}

#in this illustrative example, you need to include print, or the loop will run without producing output. 
```

numeric vector example:

```{r}
other_numbers <- c(4,7,5,2,2,3,1)

for (i in other_numbers){
  print(i) #i is looped through in the given order 
}
```

character vector example:

```{r}
letters #displaying built-in alphabet vector 

for (i in letters){
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
matrix <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 5, c(1:15))
matrix

for (i in matrix){
  print(i)
}
```

dataframe example:

```{r}
###looping through the unique political parties in our midterms dataset
for (i in unique(midterms$party)){
  print(i)
}

#note i is an object and never in quotes. i is commonly-used 
#but arbitrary. You can make it more meaningful to you if thats easier, e.g.: 

for (Parties in unique(midterms$party)){
  print(Parties)
}
```

Applying an operation by looping through the parties in the midterms
dataset

```{r}
###finding the maximum value of house_change for each party
#if we wanted to do this for ONE party, e.g. Republican 

max(midterms$house_change[midterms$party == 'Republican'])

#uses square brackets to subset, will be using this throughout the workshop
```

individual components we need to build our for loop:

1.  unique(midterms$party)
2.  max(midterms$house_change[midterms$party == Party])
3.  for loop struture:

for (i in vector){ operation }

```{r}
#building this into a for loop, for all parties
for (i in unique(midterms$party)){
  x <- max(midterms$house_change[midterms$party == i])
  print(x)
}

#can save as an object or embed max within print , i.e 
#print(max(countries$gdpPercap[countries$country == i]))
```

#PRACTICE TOGETHER

Another example, with a different dataset: finding the average latitude
for each storm in the 'storms' dataset 

individual components we need to build our for loop:

1.  unique(storms$name)
2.  mean(storms$lat[storms$name == Storm name])
3.  for loop struture:

for (i in vector){ operation }

```{r}
#storms dataset, from dplyr
head(storms)

#finding the average latitude for each storm in the dataset 

```

#PRACTICE:

Using the 'countries' dataset, use a for loop to find the maximum value
of GDP per capita (gdpPercap) for each country

```{r}
#answer: 

```

Saving the output of your for loop:

lets create a new dataset called 'country_sum', of summary variables by country, with country as one column and max gdp per capita as another

```{r}
#creating empty vectors for the values we want to store
country <- 0
maxgdp <- 0

#to store values in a vector, we need to create a count, to add values to a vector as we move through each iteration of the loop 
index <- 1

#vector[x] points to position x in the vector

for (i in unique(countries$country)){
  maxgdp[index] <- max(countries$gdpPercap[countries$country == i])
    #create vector of max gdpPercap values by country 
  country[index] <- i #create vectors of countries
  print(index) #print index at each iteration (not required)
  index <- index + 1 #add one to the index to avoid replacement
}

#look at our new vectors
head(maxgdp)
head(country)

#combine vectors into a dataframe
country_sum <- data.frame(country, maxgdp)
head(country_sum)

#there are other ways of doing this, by creating a dataframe and using that directly in the for-loop, but I think this format is more beginner-friendly 
```

#PRACTICE:

modify the code below to create a new dataframe with two columns: Party,
and max midterms house change (x in the example code). Name your columns
however you'd like.

```{r}

#original code:
for (i in unique(midterms$party)){
  x <- max(midterms$house_change[midterms$party == i])
  print(x)
}

#answer: 

```

IF/ELSE STATEMENTS

Basic structure of an if statement:

if (logical statement){ operation true}

can be expanded to an if/else statement:

if (logical statement){ operation if true} else{operation if false}

examples of logical statements:

x > 5 
x == 4 
x == "cat" 
x != 0
x %in% c("cat", "dog", "mouse")

Simple example:

```{r}

x = 6 #set x to 6 

if (x > 5){
  print("x is greater than 5")
}

x = 4 #set x to 4 

#add an else statement 
if (x > 5){
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

if/else statement become very useful when embedded within a for loop:

```{r}

#e.g., create a binary variable for Republican (1) and Democrat (0)

midterms$binary <- NA

for (i in 1:nrow(midterms)){
if(midterms$party[i] == 'Republican'){
  midterms$binary[i] = 1} else {
    midterms$binary[i] = 0
  }
}

head(midterms)
```

###PRACTICE

```{r}
#e.g., create a binary variable/column in the countries dataset called eurasia_bin, with values of 'Eurasia' and 'Elsewhere', based on this list (it is not totally accurate, but suitable for the purpose of practice): 

eurasia <- c("Europe", "Asia")

#(hint: you need to use %in%)

#answer:
```
###BONUS QUESTION

Loop through the storms dataset and calculate mean latitude for each storm. Store this in a new dataframe with storm name. 

Then, create a new grouping variable for latitude, with three levels: 'North' (>30), 'Central' (>=20, <=30), 'South' (<20). 

```{r}
#answer: 

```
